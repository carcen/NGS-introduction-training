## Learning outcomes

After this course, you will be able to:

* Understand the basics of the different NGS technologies
* Perform quality control for better downstream analysis
* Align reads to a reference genome
* Visualize the output


## Learning experiences

This course will consist of lectures, practicals and polls. During practicals and polls, you are free to discuss with other participants. During lectures, focus on the lecture only.

### Asking questions
During lectures, raise your hand if:

  - things aren't clear
  - you think your question is of direct interest to other participants

A main source of communication will be our [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ngsqualitycon-c8g5456/shared_invite/zt-hwth7xrb-vYpga8sUye_7Ij9x6OkyKA). During the practicals, use the slack channel #peer-q-and-a to ask any question. This channel is not only meant for asking questions but also for answering questions of other students. Answer questions only if you have finished the practical block, and use the "answer in thread" option. The teacher will review the answers, and add/modify if necessary.

### Practicals
Each block has practical work involved. Some more than others. The practicals are subdivided into chapters, and we'll have a (short) discussion after each chapter. All answers to the practicals are incorporated, but they are hidden. Do the exercise first by yourself, before checking out the answer. If your answer is different from the answer in the practicals, try to figure out why they are different.

Each practical unit has an expected time to complete. Let us know if you're finished in the slack poll at the channel #polls. When most participants have finished before the expected time, we'll discuss it right away. If most participants aren't finished at the expected time, we'll postpone the discussion.
